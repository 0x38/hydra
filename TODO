# test for demos/4_sweep WIP
* Try to incorporate user config families into --help dynamically.
* Flow to create an empty hydra app for quick start
* consider xar integration: https://github.com/facebookincubator/xar and https://pypi.org/project/pex/
* Create additional demos:
  * Demo with instantiating classes from config
  * Demo for specializing configuration depending on multiple selected config families
  * Demo on debugging configuration composition (or just a few words somewhere?)
* pass in an  explicit name instead of deducing from calling filename
* allow overriding environment variables for jobs?
* integrate with bash-completion (see mbrl for example)
* improve test coverage
* integrate with tox and travis (or circleci)



DONE:
* create a singleton containing hydra specific variables that are potentially only known at runtime
    job:id : System agnostic job ID
    job:num : Job number is the current sweep

* add --run, --cfg, --sweep mutually exclusive flags to control behavior. default --run.
* simplify the config for composing config.
* add unit testing to ensure behavior described in demos is preserved
    * test for demos/0_minimal
    * test for demos/1_config
    * test for demos/2_compose
    * test for demos/3_default
* Sweep demo

Over 4K imports of argparse.

1. Logs of argparse.
2. Lots of hard coded specialization:
        if arch == "vgg16":
            if conv < 3:
                av = 18
                s = 9216
            elif conv < 5:
                av = 14
                s = 8192
            elif conv < 8:
                av = 9
                s = 9216
            ...
