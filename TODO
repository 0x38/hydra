* add --run, --cfg, --sweep mutually exclusive flags to control behavior. default --run.
* add unit testing to ensure behavior described in demos is preserved
* Try to incorporate user config families into --help dynamically.
* Flow to create an empty hydra app for quick start
* consider xar integration: https://github.com/facebookincubator/xar and https://pypi.org/project/pex/
* Create additional demos:
  * Sweep demo
  * Demo with instantiating classes from config
  * Demo for specializing configuration depending on multiple selected config families
* pass in an  explicit name instead of deducing from calling filename

DONE:
* simplify the config for composing config.
