  # lets say if we are using nesterov, then we want to use different momentum for imagenet and cifar.
  # we can achieve this by adding a file who'se name depends on the current optimizer and the current dataset.
  # those files should contain just the what makes nesterov different in imagenet and what makes it different cifar

# optional configurations
optional:
# this goes under optional because we are knowingly missing adam_cifar10 and adam_imagenet,
# and we don't want to get an error when we try to load them.
